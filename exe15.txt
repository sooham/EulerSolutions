Simple observation and combinatorics show there is a
relationship bwtween the binomial coefficients and the
general solutions to an n by n size grid.

Namely, that the number of paths direct from the top-left
to the bottom right corner for an n by n grid will be 
(2n)!/(n! * n!). Plugging in 20 gives the answer.
